Every client I talk to wants AI in their product. The difference between a gimmick and a game-changer comes down to implementation. Here's how I approach building AI-powered features in production apps.

## The Modern AI Stack

The tooling has matured significantly. Here's what I'm using in production today:

- **LLM Provider**: Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT-4o for reasoning tasks
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for semantic search
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or Supabase pgvector for storing embeddings
- **Orchestration**: LangChain or custom pipelines depending on complexity
- **Frontend**: Next.js with streaming responses via the AI SDK

## Pattern 1: Conversational Interfaces

The most requested feature. But a good AI chat isn't just calling an API — it requires:

- **Context management** — Maintaining conversation history without blowing token limits
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** — Grounding responses in your actual data
- **Streaming** — Showing responses token-by-token for perceived speed
- **Guardrails** — Preventing hallucinations and keeping responses on-topic

## Pattern 2: Intelligent Search

Traditional keyword search is dead for many use cases. Semantic search with embeddings lets users find content by meaning, not just matching words. I've implemented this for e-commerce product discovery, documentation search, and internal knowledge bases.

## Pattern 3: Content Generation

From email drafts to product descriptions to report summaries — AI content generation saves hours of manual work. The key is building in human review workflows so AI assists rather than replaces judgment.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-relying on a single model** — Always have a fallback provider
2. **Ignoring costs** — Token usage adds up fast. Cache aggressively and use smaller models where possible
3. **Skipping evaluation** — You need metrics to know if your AI feature is actually helping users
4. **No rate limiting** — Protect your API keys and budget with proper throttling

## Getting Started

Start small. Pick one feature in your app that would benefit from AI — search, summarization, or recommendations are great entry points. Build a prototype, measure the impact, then expand. The worst approach is trying to "AI everything" at once.

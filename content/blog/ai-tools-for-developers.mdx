The AI tools landscape for developers is exploding. Here are the ones I actually use daily and recommend.

## Code Editors & Assistants

### Cursor
Cursor has become my primary editor. The AI integration feels native, and the ability to chat with your codebase is a game-changer for large projects.

### GitHub Copilot
Still the gold standard for inline code suggestions. Works best when you write clear function names and comments.

## AI APIs & Platforms

### Anthropic Claude
My go-to for complex reasoning tasks, code review, and architecture discussions. Claude's ability to understand nuanced technical requirements is unmatched.

### OpenAI GPT-4
Excellent for general-purpose AI tasks, content generation, and quick prototyping. The API ecosystem is mature and well-documented.

## Development Workflow

### V0 by Vercel
Generates UI components from text descriptions. Great for rapid prototyping and exploring design ideas.

### Perplexity
Research and documentation tasks. When you need to understand a new library or debug an obscure issue, Perplexity surfaces relevant information quickly.

## The Key Takeaway

Don't try to adopt every tool at once. Start with one that addresses your biggest pain point, master it, then expand your toolkit.

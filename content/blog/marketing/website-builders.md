Website builders have become increasingly popular in recent years, promising a quick and easy solution to creating a website without the need for coding knowledge or technical expertise. However, while they may seem like an attractive option for small business owners on a budget, using website builders can ultimately be detrimental to your business. Here are some statistics that illustrate why:

1. **Limited Customization Options**

Website builders offer pre-made templates that users can choose from to build their website. While this may seem like a quick and easy solution, it severely limits the level of customization that is possible. A study by Blue Corona found that 48% of people cited a website's design as the number one factor in deciding the credibility of a business. If your website looks like a generic template, it may be perceived as less credible and less professional.

2. **Slow Load Times**

Website builders often use bloated code that can result in slow load times. A study by Google found that the probability of bounce increases by 32% as page load time goes from 1 second to 3 seconds. Slow load times can lead to frustrated users and lost potential customers.

3. **Poor Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**

SEO is critical for any website, as it helps potential customers find your business through search engines. Website builders often generate messy code that can hinder SEO efforts. In fact, a study by Ahrefs found that 91% of web pages get no organic traffic from Google due to poor SEO.

4. **Limited Functionality**

Website builders may offer basic features, but they often lack the advanced functionality that businesses need to succeed online. For example, if you want to create an e-commerce store, you may need to pay extra for a more advanced plan or integrate with third-party tools that may not work seamlessly with the website builder.

5. **Security Concerns**

Website builders may not be as secure as a custom-built website. They often use generic security measures that may not be enough to protect your website from potential hacks or data breaches. In fact, a study by Small Business Trends found that 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses.

In conclusion, using website builders may seem like an easy and cost-effective solution, but it can ultimately be harmful to your business. The limited customization options, slow load times, poor SEO, limited functionality, and security concerns can all impact your business's credibility, customer experience, and overall success online. While custom-built websites may require a larger investment upfront, they offer greater flexibility, functionality, and security, and can ultimately lead to a better return on investment in the long run.

Every week I get on calls with business owners who say some version of "we know we should be doing something with AI, but we don't know where to start." Here's the framework I walk them through.

## Start with the Problem, Not the Technology

The biggest mistake I see is companies chasing AI because it sounds impressive. Forget the hype. Look at your actual business and ask:

- Where is your team burning hours on repetitive work?
- What decisions could be better if you had faster access to data?
- Where are customers dropping off or getting frustrated?

Those answers tell you exactly where AI can make the most impact.

## Three Implementations That Actually Work

### Customer Service Automation
Modern AI chatbots are nothing like the awful ones from five years ago. A well-built system can handle complex queries, learn from conversations, and know when to escalate to a real person. I've seen this cut support ticket volume by 40-60% for clients.

### Content Generation
Marketing teams are using AI to draft blog posts, social media content, email campaigns, and internal docs. The key is treating AI as a first-draft generator, not a finished-product machine. A human still reviews and refines everything.

### Data Analysis
Most businesses are sitting on data they've never properly analyzed. AI can surface patterns and insights from your existing data in minutes that would take a team weeks to find manually.

## When You'll See Results

Done right, most AI implementations show clear ROI within 3-6 months. The trick is starting with one high-impact use case and nailing it before expanding. Trying to "AI everything" at once is a recipe for wasted money and frustrated teams.

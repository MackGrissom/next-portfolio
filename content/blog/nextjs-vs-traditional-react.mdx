Clients ask me this all the time: "Do I need Next.js or is plain React fine?" Short answer: it depends on what you're building. Here's how I think about it.

## Go with Next.js When...

- **SEO matters.** Server-side rendering gives search engines fully rendered pages. If you need to rank on Google, this is huge.
- **Performance is a priority.** Automatic code splitting, image optimization, edge functions. Next.js handles a ton of this out of the box.
- **You want full-stack in one repo.** API routes, server actions, middleware. No need for a separate backend for many use cases.
- **Your site is content-heavy.** Blogs, portfolios, marketing pages. Static generation makes these insanely fast.

## Stick with Vite + React When...

- **You're building internal tools.** Admin dashboards and internal apps don't need SEO. A simpler setup gets you moving faster.
- **It's a single-page app.** If the whole app lives behind a login, client-side rendering works fine.
- **You're prototyping.** Speed of setup matters more than long-term architecture when you're validating an idea.

## What I Default To

Nine times out of ten, I reach for Next.js on client projects. The performance wins, SEO benefits, and full-stack capabilities make it worth the slightly steeper learning curve. The ecosystem is mature and the community is massive, which means fewer surprises in production.

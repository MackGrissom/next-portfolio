One of the most common questions I get from clients is whether they need Next.js or if a traditional React setup would suffice. The answer depends on your specific needs.

## When to Choose Next.js

Next.js shines when you need:

- **SEO** — Server-side rendering and static generation give search engines fully rendered pages
- **Performance** — Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and edge functions
- **Full-stack capabilities** — API routes, server actions, and middleware
- **Content-heavy sites** — Blogs, portfolios, and marketing sites benefit from static generation

## When Traditional React is Enough

Stick with Vite + React when:

- **Internal tools** — Admin dashboards and internal apps don't need SEO
- **SPAs** — Single-page applications where client-side rendering is preferred
- **Simple prototypes** — Quick prototypes and MVPs where speed of setup matters

## My Recommendation

For most client projects, I default to Next.js. The performance benefits, SEO advantages, and full-stack capabilities outweigh the slight increase in complexity. The ecosystem and community support make it a safe long-term choice.

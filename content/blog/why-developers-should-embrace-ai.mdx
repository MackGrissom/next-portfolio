The rise of AI tools has created a divide in the developer community. Some see it as a threat, while others recognize it as the most powerful productivity multiplier we've ever had.

## The Reality of AI in Development

AI isn't replacing developers — it's making them exponentially more productive. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude are changing how we write, review, and debug code.

The developers who embrace these tools are shipping faster, writing more robust code, and spending less time on boilerplate. Those who resist are falling behind.

## How I Use AI in My Workflow

- **Code generation** — AI handles repetitive patterns while I focus on architecture
- **Code review** — AI catches bugs and suggests improvements I might miss
- **Documentation** — AI generates clear docs from complex code
- **Problem solving** — AI helps explore solutions and edge cases faster

## The Bottom Line

AI is a tool, not a replacement. The best developers will be those who learn to leverage AI effectively while maintaining strong fundamentals. The future belongs to developers who can direct AI, not compete with it.

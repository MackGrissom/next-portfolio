There's a real split happening in the developer community right now. Half the people I talk to are terrified that AI is coming for their jobs. The other half are quietly shipping 3x more work than they did a year ago.

## What's Actually Happening

I've been using AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude) in my daily work for over a year now. I'm not writing less code. I'm writing *better* code, faster. The repetitive stuff that used to eat half my afternoon? Gone. The boilerplate I used to copy-paste from old projects? Generated in seconds.

The developers leaning into these tools are outpacing everyone else. That's just the reality right now.

## How I Actually Use AI Day to Day

- **Code generation**: I describe what I need, the AI writes the first draft, I refine it. Saves me 30-60 minutes per feature.
- **Code review**: I run my PRs through Claude before pushing. It catches things I miss, especially edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Writing docs used to be the thing I procrastinated on. Now I generate a first pass from the code and clean it up.
- **Debugging**: When I'm stuck, I paste the error + context into Claude and get pointed in the right direction almost immediately.

## My Take

The developers who will thrive are the ones who learn to work *with* AI. Strong fundamentals still matter. Understanding system design still matters. But if you're not using these tools yet, you're working harder than you need to.

I've built AI features into dozens of client projects at this point, and I have strong opinions about when to use Claude versus GPT. This is based on production experience, not benchmarks.

## Where Claude Wins

### Complex Reasoning and Code
Claude consistently does better on tasks that require multi-step reasoning, understanding nuanced requirements, and generating production-quality code. When I need an AI to understand a full codebase and make architectural decisions, Claude is my first pick.

### Long Context
Claude's ability to process and reason over very long documents is the best available right now. For clients with large codebases, extensive documentation, or complex data analysis needs, Claude handles the full context without losing quality.

### Following Instructions
Claude is remarkably good at following detailed system prompts and maintaining character. This matters a lot for building customer-facing AI features where consistency is critical.

## Where GPT Wins

### Speed and Cost
GPT-4o-mini is incredibly fast and cheap. For high-volume, lower-complexity tasks like classification, extraction, or simple summarization, it's hard to beat on cost-efficiency.

### Ecosystem
OpenAI's ecosystem is more mature. Better SDKs, more third-party integrations, wider range of fine-tuning options. If you need image generation, text-to-speech, or vision in the same pipeline, their unified API makes that easy.

### Function Calling
GPT's structured output and function calling capabilities have been battle-tested in production for longer, though Claude has closed this gap a lot recently.

## What I Actually Do on Projects

For most projects, I run a multi-model setup:

- **Claude** for the core reasoning engine: complex conversations, code generation, analysis
- **GPT-4o-mini** for high-volume utility tasks: classification, extraction, embeddings
- **Fallback routing**: if one provider goes down, traffic automatically routes to the other

## The Real Answer

The best model depends entirely on your use case. Don't marry a provider. Build abstractions that let you swap models easily. This space moves too fast to lock yourself in.

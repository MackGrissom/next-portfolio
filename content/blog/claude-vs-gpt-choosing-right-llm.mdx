After building AI features into dozens of client projects, I've developed strong opinions about when to use Claude versus GPT. Here's an honest comparison based on production experience — not benchmarks.

## Where Claude Excels

### Complex Reasoning and Code
Claude consistently outperforms on tasks that require multi-step reasoning, understanding nuanced requirements, and generating production-quality code. When I need an AI to understand a full codebase and make architectural decisions, Claude is my first choice.

### Long Context
Claude's ability to process and reason over very long documents is unmatched. For clients with large codebases, extensive documentation, or complex data analysis needs, Claude handles the full context without degradation.

### Following Instructions
Claude is remarkably good at following detailed system prompts and maintaining character. This matters for building customer-facing AI features where consistency is critical.

## Where GPT Excels

### Speed and Cost
GPT-4o-mini is incredibly fast and cheap. For high-volume, lower-complexity tasks like classification, extraction, or simple summarization, it's hard to beat on cost-efficiency.

### Ecosystem
OpenAI's ecosystem is more mature — better SDKs, more third-party integrations, and a wider range of fine-tuning options. If you need image generation, text-to-speech, or vision in the same pipeline, OpenAI's unified API is convenient.

### Function Calling
GPT's structured output and function calling capabilities are slightly more battle-tested in production, though Claude has closed this gap significantly.

## My Default Strategy

For most projects, I use a **multi-model approach**:

- **Claude** for the core reasoning engine — complex conversations, code generation, analysis
- **GPT-4o-mini** for high-volume utility tasks — classification, extraction, embeddings
- **Fallback routing** — if one provider is down, traffic automatically routes to the other

## The Real Answer

The best model depends entirely on your use case. Don't marry a provider — build abstractions that let you swap models easily. The AI landscape moves too fast to lock yourself in.

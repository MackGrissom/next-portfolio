I switched to Cursor about a year ago and I genuinely can't imagine going back to VS Code. Here's what makes it different and why I think it matters.

## Why Cursor Feels Different

Most AI coding tools bolt AI features onto an existing editor. Cursor was built with AI at the core from day one. The big difference? It understands your *entire* codebase, not just the file you have open. That changes everything.

## What I Actually Use Every Day

### Codebase Chat
I can ask "where is the authentication middleware?" or "how does the payment flow work?" and get answers that reference specific files and line numbers. This is a lifesaver when I'm jumping into a client's existing codebase.

### Multi-file Editing
This is the killer feature. I describe a change that touches five different files, and Cursor generates the edits across all of them in one shot. No other tool does this well.

### Smart Refactoring
"Refactor this component to use the new API pattern" and it applies consistent changes throughout the project. I used to spend entire afternoons on refactors that now take minutes.

## Where It Falls Short

I want to be honest about this: Cursor hallucinates sometimes. It'll suggest API calls that don't exist, use deprecated patterns, or overcomplicate simple things. You still need to review everything it generates. Think of it as a really fast pair programmer who occasionally needs to be corrected.

## Worth It?

Absolutely. Cursor is the single biggest productivity boost I've experienced as a developer. If you write code for a living and you haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a week.

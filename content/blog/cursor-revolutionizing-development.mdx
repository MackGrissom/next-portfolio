Cursor has fundamentally changed how I write code. Here's what makes it different from other AI-assisted editors.

## What Makes Cursor Different

Unlike bolt-on AI features, Cursor was built from the ground up with AI at its core. The editor understands your entire codebase, not just the file you're working on.

## Features I Use Daily

### Codebase Chat
Ask questions about your project and get answers that reference specific files and functions. This is invaluable for onboarding to new codebases.

### Multi-file Editing
Describe a change that spans multiple files, and Cursor generates the edits across all of them. This is where traditional code assistants fall short.

### Smart Refactoring
Cursor understands intent. Tell it to "refactor this to use the new API" and it applies consistent changes throughout your codebase.

## When It Struggles

Cursor isn't perfect. It can hallucinate API calls, suggest deprecated patterns, and sometimes generates overly complex solutions. The key is treating it as a highly capable pair programmer, not an autonomous developer.

## The Verdict

Cursor is the most significant productivity improvement I've experienced in years. If you're not using it, you're leaving significant value on the table.

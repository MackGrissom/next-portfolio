# Executive Leaderboard: Building a Premium Job Platform

## The Challenge
Executive Leaderboard needed a sophisticated platform to connect high-level executives with exclusive career opportunities. The platform required:
- Secure authentication for sensitive executive information
- Custom web scraping to aggregate positions from multiple sources
- Premium subscription management
- Responsive design for all devices

## The Approach
I implemented a modern tech stack including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase to create a scalable, performant solution:

1. **Authentication System**: Implemented Clerk for secure, multi-factor authentication
2. **Custom Web Scraper**: Developed an automated system to aggregate executive positions
3. **Payment Integration**: Integrated Stripe for subscription management
4. **Responsive UI**: Created a premium user experience across all devices

## The Results
The platform launched successfully with:
- 200+ executive positions aggregated in the first month
- 40% conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription
- 98% client satisfaction rating
- Seamless content management for the client team

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase
- Clerk Authentication
- Stripe Payments

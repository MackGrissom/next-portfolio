Sumorize is an open-source AI-powered tool that takes any article or webpage URL and generates concise, accurate summaries using OpenAI's GPT-4 API.

## Project Highlights

- **One-Click Summaries** — Paste any URL and get an instant AI-generated summary
- **GPT-4 Integration** — Leverages the latest OpenAI model for high-quality text comprehension
- **History Tracking** — Saves previous summaries for easy reference
- **Open Source** — Fully open-source codebase for community contributions

## Technical Implementation

Built with React, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application interfaces with the OpenAI API for content analysis and summarization, with Redux managing the application state including summary history and user preferences.

ASCII Hub is a library of 21 professional ASCII animations you can customize and copy directly into any React project. Every animation is a standalone component with zero external dependencies.

## Project Highlights

- **21 Animations** — Matrix Rain, Plasma, Fire, DNA Helix, Starfield, Game of Life, Tie-Dye, and more
- **Fully Customizable** — Adjust colors, font size, dimensions, and character sets per animation
- **Copy-Paste Ready** — One click to copy any animation as a self-contained JSX component
- **Zero Dependencies** — Pure React with no animation libraries required

## Technical Implementation

Each animation runs on requestAnimationFrame or setInterval loops with procedural math to generate ASCII art frames in real-time. The project is built with Vite and React 18, with a showcase UI that lets users tweak settings and preview changes live before copying the component code.

## Animations

Includes Matrix Rain, Ocean Wave, Fire, DNA Helix, Starfield, Radar Sweep, Equalizer, 3D Cube, Typewriter, Pulsing Heart, Rain, Spinner, Plasma, Sine Snake, Game of Life, Analog Clock, Bouncing Ball, Glitch Text, Mandala, Progress Bar, and Tie-Dye.

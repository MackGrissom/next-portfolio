Weightless is a concept job board designed specifically for digital nomads and remote workers. The platform mockup demonstrates how location-independent professionals can discover and apply for opportunities that match their lifestyle.

## Project Highlights

- **Modern job board UI** — clean, filterable job listings with detailed position information
- **Location-aware design** — features global job distribution and timezone-friendly information
- **Digital nomad focused** — tailored categories and filters for remote and travel-friendly positions
- **Responsive design** — works seamlessly on any device, from laptops to phones

## Technical Implementation

Built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. The UI was designed in Figma with a focus on usability and visual appeal, then developed as a fully responsive frontend application.

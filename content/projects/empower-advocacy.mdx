Empower Advocacy is a professional landing page for a special education consultant based in Georgia, USA. The site was designed to convey trust and professionalism while making it easy for families to understand available services and get in touch.

## Project Highlights

- **Accessibility-first design** — built with WCAG guidelines in mind, ensuring all families can access the information they need
- **Mobile-responsive** — optimized for the on-the-go parents who make up the primary audience
- **Clear information architecture** — services, testimonials, and contact information are easy to find
- **Fast load times** — built with Vite for optimal performance

## Technical Implementation

Built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS for rapid development and excellent performance. The design was prototyped in Figma before development, ensuring the client's vision was captured accurately.
